"""
Script Name:  fortinet_backup_v2.py
Description:  Update to Fortinet firewall backup script to leverage a REST API Admin to connect to the firewall and execute config backup command
Directions:   Scripts requires a REST API token generated from the firewall. This includes creating a REST API Admin profile with appropriate permissions, creating a REST API Admin user associated with the previously created REST API admin profile and setting trusted host. 
Updates:      Removed netmiko library and prompts for username/password. Added Requests library for HTTP client and adjusted code to leverage library. Adjusted prompts for just IP of firewall and port used to access GUI of firewall (HTTPS port). 

NOTE:  This version of the script requires a hard code of the API Token generated from the Fortinet.
